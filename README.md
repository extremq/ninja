This is the repository of the semi-official Transformice **#ninja** module!
# What's ninja?
Ninja is a module for the game Transformice.

It's written in Lua (similarly to ROBLOX) and it's a complex minigame which empowers players with ninja abilities. I wrote a dynamic GUI system for it using only primitives (window, image, text) in Lua, it has a player database and it's based on async events.
At times, it had over [100 concurrent players](https://i.imgur.com/cKN84BE.png). [Here](https://youtu.be/qJC8t1gVC-s) is a video showcasing gameplay with 40 players.
